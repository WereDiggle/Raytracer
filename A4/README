note that the program assumes all mesh obj files are located in the Assets folder

Tested on gl29.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca

COMPILE TIME FLAGS
##################

SUPER_SAMPLING in A4.cpp controls how many samples to use per pixel.
The square of the number is the number of samples per pixel used. 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, etc.

BOUNDING_BOX_ONLY in Mesh.hpp controls whether to show only the bounding boxes or not.
Set true to show only the bounding boxes.

FEATURES
########

The extra feature that was implemented for this assignment is super sampling.
It's controlled by a compile time flag. 
See macho-cows_super_1, macho-cows_super_2, macho-cows_super_3 for examples of different anti aliasing levels

SCENES
######

The sample.lua script should will generate a 1920x1080 image titled 'the destruction of Alderaan'
Pretend the cows are star destroyers.
It might take a while to ray trace, so feel free to scale down the image.
A pre ray traced image is already provided.
super sampled at 2x2
