COMPILATION
###########

The build process is the same as A4. Actually, everything is still in the A4 directory, and nothing has been renamed.

premake4 gmake
make
./A4 Assets/bath.lua

High resolution images of the project are stored inside of the A4/Images/hi_res directory.

All other images from lua scripts will be saved to the Images directory automatically. 
There are a bunch of lua scripts in the Assets directory which I used to generate the demo images.

I do not guarantee that all the scripts will generate exactly the same image. 
This is mostly due to the photon mapping. 
Most of the demo images were ray traced without photon mapping turned on. 
To turn off photon mapping, you need to change the NUM_PHOTONS constant in Settings.hpp to 0. 
Then rebuild.

The scripts are:
refraction.lua
reflection.lua
water.lua
photon_map.lua
texture_map.lua
bump_map.lua
noise.lua
bath.lua

COMPILE TIME FLAGS
##################

SUPER_SAMPLING in A4.cpp controls how many samples to use per pixel.
The square of the number is the number of samples per pixel used. 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, etc.

BOUNDING_BOX_ONLY in Mesh.hpp controls whether to show only the bounding boxes or not.
Set true to show only the bounding boxes.

Photon mapping flags are all in Settings.hpp
There are some other flags in there as well with descriptions of what they do.
